## üß† Purpose

This repository documents my personal journey toward becoming a cybersecurity professional. Every project here was created to reinforce knowledge, demonstrate applied skills, and simulate the kinds of challenges faced by security analysts, engineers, and researchers in the field.

Each project is self-contained and focuses on specific topics such as:

- Threat detection and incident response
- Security automation using Python and Bash
- Log analysis and SIEM data parsing
- Network forensics and packet analysis
- Red and blue team exercises
- Malware sandboxing and behavioral analysis
